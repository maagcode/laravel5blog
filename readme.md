# Laravel 5.2 Blog Base

Fully custom Blog, created on Laravel 5.2 and coded from the ground up.

Created full CRUD and commented it for ease of understanding and simple customization. Authentication was made using the base Laravel Auth (not using the 'artisan make:auth').

## Components used in the project

Simple tools were used in the project like:

- Bootstrap
- Laravel Collective (HTML & Forms)

## Project still in process...

There are still some tweaks I will be doing to the project. I am planning to add more styling, implement some Javascript validation and any other ideas that might come up in the process.


## Use of the Blog

Feel free to clone and use the project to your liking.

Happy Coding!!!ÃŸ
